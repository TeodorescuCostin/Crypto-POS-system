# Crypto-POS- Terminal-system
This is a softwear written in python+kivy that is suitted for every new pos system that runs on an os like android or similar. You can accept crypto payments that will go into a walleet that is generated every time you start a cycle. This is in a very beta stage so it still has some problems in some places.




Before uploading the project keep in mind to create an additional file: "info.txt".
